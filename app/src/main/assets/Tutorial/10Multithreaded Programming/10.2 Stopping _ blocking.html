	<pre>
		

Stopping a thread:
Whenever we want to stop a thread from running further,we may do so by calling its stop() method, like:
aThread.stop();

This statement cause the thread to move to the dead state.The stop method may used when the premature death of a thread is desired.

Blocking a thread:
A thread can also be temporarily suspended or blocked from entering into the runnable and subsequently running state by using either of the following thread methods:
sleep()	
//blocked for a specified time

suspend()	
//blocked until further orders

wait()	
//blocked until certain condition occurs
These methods cause the thread to go into the blocked(or not-runnable) state.
