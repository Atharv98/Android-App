Lets see what this is :
class keyword is used to declare a class in java.

public keyword is an access modifier which represents visibility, it means it is visible to all.

static is a keyword, if we declare any method as static, it is known as static method. The main method is executed by the JVM, it doesn't require to create object to invoke the main method. So it saves memory.

void is the return type of method, it means it doesn't return any value.

main is a entry point of the program. Execution of programs starts from main. It is called by Runtime System

String[] args is used for command line argument. We will learn it later.

System.out.println() is used print statement.
