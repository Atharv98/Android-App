	<h1><center>13.1 Stream Classes</center></h1>
	<pre>
		

The java.io package contains Stream classes which provide capabilities for processing all types of data.
Java performs I/O through Streams. A Stream is linked to a physical layer by java I/O system to make input and output operation in java.
In general, a stream means continuous flow of data. Streams are clean way to deal with input/output without having every part of your code understand the physical. All these streams represent an input source and an output destination. The stream in the java.io package supports many data such as primitives, Object, localized characters, etc.

These classes may be categorized into two groups based on their data type handling capabilities:-
1. Byte Stream
2. Charater Stream

The InputStream & OutputStream class providing support for handling I/O operations on bytes are type of byte stream.

The Reader & Writer class providing support for handling I/O operations on characters are type of char stream. Character stream uses Unicode and therefore can be internationalized.
