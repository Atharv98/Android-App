	<h1><center>13.3 Character Stream</center></h1>
	<pre>
		

Java Character streams are used to perform input and output for 16-bit unicode. Though there are many classes related to character streams but the most frequently used classes are , Reader and Writer.
Though internally FileReader uses FileInputStream and FileWriter uses FileOutputStream but here major difference is that FileReader reads two bytes at a time and FileWriter writes two bytes at a time.

Reader
- It is an abstract class used to input character.
- It implements 2 interfaces Closable & Readable.
- Methods in this class throws IO Exception(Except markSupported()).

Writer
- Writer is an abstract class used to output character.
- It implements 3 interfaces Closable, Flushable & Appendable.

methods of Reader abstract class
abstract void close()
close the source of input.

void mark(int numChars)
it marks a point to input stream that will stay valid until numChars are read.

boolean markSupported()
it returns true if mark() support by stream.

int read()
it returns integer of next available character from input

int read(char buffer[])
it read up to the length of byte in buffer

abstract read(byte buffer[], int offset, int numBytes)
it read up to the length of character in buffer starting form offset

void reset()
it reads the input pointer.

long skip(long numBytes)
it returns the character ignored.

boolean ready()
if input request will not wait returns true, otherwise false

methods of Writer abstract class
write append(char ch) 
It append the 'ch' character at last of output stream

write append(charSequence chars)
append the chars at end of output stream.

write append(charSequence chars, int begin, int end)
append the characters specified in the range.

abstract void close()
close the output stream

abstract void flush()
it flush the output buffer.

void write(char buffer[])
writes array of character to output stream.

abstract void write(char buffer[], int offset, int numChars)
it writes a range of characters from buffer starting form offset

void write(String str)
it writes the str to output stream

void write(String str, int offset, int numChars)
it writes a range of character from the string str starting at offset.
