- File class is used to support with Files and File systems.
- File class describes properties of itself.
- File class has its objects which is used to handle or get data stored in disk.
- File class has some constructors which is used to describe the file path.

Constructors : 
File(String directoryPath)
File(String directoryPath, String filename)
File(File dirObj, String filename)
File(URl uriObj)

FileInputStream:
This stream is used for reading data from the files. Objects can be created using the keyword new and there are several types of constructors available.

Following constructor takes a file name as a string to create an input stream object to read the file.:
InputStream f = new FileInputStream("C:/java/hello");

Following constructor takes a file object to create an input stream object to read the file. First we create a file object using File() method as follows:
File f = new File("C:/java/hello");
InputStream f = new FileInputStream(f);

FileOutputStream:
FileOutputStream is used to create a file and write data into it. The stream would create a file, if it doesn't already exist, before opening it for output.

Here are two constructors which can be used to create a FileOutputStream object.
Following constructor takes a file name as a string to create an input stream object to write the file:
OutputStream f = new FileOutputStream("C:/java/hello") 

Following constructor takes a file object to create an output stream object to write the file. First, we create a file object using File() method as follows:
File f = new File("C:/java/hello");
OutputStream f = new FileOutputStream(f);

I/O Exceptions
EOFException
It indicates the signal are reached to end of file during input.

FileNotFoundException
It indicates that the file not found at specified path.

InterruptedIOException
It indicates that an I/O Exception has occurred

I/O Exception
It indicates I/O Exception some sort has occurred.
