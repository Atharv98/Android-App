<h1><center>6.3 Constructors</center></h1>
<pre>
Constructor in java is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object.
Java constructor is invoked at the time of object creation. It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the object therefore it is known as constructor.

Rules for creating java constructor
There are basically two rules defined for the constructor.
- Constructor name must be same as its class name
- Constructor must have no explicit return type

Types of java constructors
There are two types of constructors:
Default constructor (no-arg constructor)
Parameterized constructor

Java Default Constructor
A constructor that have no parameter is known as default constructor.
Syntax of default constructor:
<class_name>(){ } 

Example
In this example, we are creating the no-arg constructor in the Bike class. It will be invoked at the time of object creation.

class Bike1{ 
Bike1(){
System.out.println("Bike is created");
} 
public static void main(String args[]){ 
Bike1 b=new Bike1(); 
} 
} 

Java parameterized constructor
A constructor that have parameters is known as parameterized constructor.

Why use parameterized constructor?
Parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to the distinct objects.

Example
In this example, we have created the constructor of Student class that have two parameters. We can have any number of parameters in the constructor.

class Student4{ 
int id; 
String name; 
Student4(int i,String n){ 
id = i; 
name = n; 
} 

void display(){
System.out.println(id+" "+name);
} 

public static void main(String args[]){ 
Student4 s1 = new Student4(111,"Karan"); 
Student4 s2 = new Student4(222,"Aryan"); 
s1.display(); 
s2.display();


} 
}
