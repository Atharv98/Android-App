<h1><center>6.5 Method Overriding</center></h1>
<pre>
	

If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in java.
In other words, If subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been provided by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding.

Rules for method overriding:
1. The argument list should be exactly the same as that of the overridden method.
2. The return type should be the same or a subtype of the return type declared in the original overridden method in the superclass.
3. The access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method's access level.
4. Instance methods can be overridden only if they are inherited by the subclass.
5. A method declared final cannot be overridden.
6. A method declared static cannot be overridden but can be re-declared.
7. If a method cannot be inherited, then it cannot be overridden.
8. A subclass within the same package as the instance's superclass can override any superclass method that is not declared private or final.
9. A subclass in a different package can only override the non-final methods declared public or protected.
10. Constructors cannot be overridden.

Advantage:
The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class(base class). 

Example: 
class Base{
public void display()
{
System.out.println("this is base class");
}
}

class Child extends Base{
public void display(){
System.out.println("this is child class");
}
public static void main( String args[]) {
Child obj = new Child();
obj.display();
}
}

output
this is child class

Using the super keyword:
When invoking a base class version of an overridden method the super keyword is used. class Base{
public void display()
{
System.out.println("this is base class");
}
}

class Child extends Base{
public void display(){
super.display(); // invokes the super class method System.out.println("this is child class");
}
public static void main( String args[]) {
Child obj = new Child();
obj.display();
}
}

output
this is base class
this is child class
