	<h1><center>4.1 Operators</center></h1>
	<pre>
Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups:
- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Misc Operators

Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra.
arithmetic operators:
+ Additive operator (also used for String concatenation)
- Subtraction operator
* Multiplication operator
/ Division operator
% Remainder operator

Relational Operators:
There are following relational operators supported by Java language
> Greater than
< Less than
== Equal to
!= Not equal to
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to

Bitwise Operators:
Java defines several bitwise operators, which can be applied to the integer types, long, int, short, char, and byte.
Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit-by-bit operation. 

~ Unary bitwise complement
<< Signed left shift
>> Signed right shift
>>> Unsigned right shift & Bitwise AND
^ Bitwise exclusive OR
| Bitwise inclusive OR

Logical Operators:
The following table lists the logical operators:
&& Conditional-AND
|| Conditional-OR
?: Ternary (shorthand for if-then-else statement)

Assignment Operators:
There are following assignment operators supported by Java language:
= Simple assignment operator
+= Add AND assignment operator
-= Subtract AND assignment operator
*= Multiply AND assignment operator
/= Divide AND assignment operator
%= Modulus AND assignment operator
<<= Left shift AND assignment operator.
>>= Right shift AND assignment operator
&= Bitwise AND assignment operator.
^= bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator.
|= bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator.

Increment and Decrement Operators
Increment and decrement operators are used to add or subtract 1 from the current value of oprand.
++ increment
-- decrement

Increment and Decrement operators can be prefix or postfix. 
In the prefix style the value of oprand is changed before the result of expression and in the postfix style the variable is modified after result.

For eg.
a = 9;
b = a++ + 5;
/* a=10 b=14 */

a = 9;
b = ++a + 5;
/* a=10 b=15 */

Miscellaneous Operators
There are few other operators supported by Java Language.
Conditional Operator ( ? : )
Conditional operator is also known as the ternary operator.
The operator is written as:
variable x = (expression) ? value if true : value if false

Instance of Operator:
This operator is used only for object reference variables.
instanceof operator is wriiten as:
( Object reference variable ) instanceof (class/interface type)
