	<h1><center>8.4 Accessing Interface</center></h1>
	<pre>

interfaces can be used to declare a set of constants that can be used in different classes. 
This is similar to creating header files in c++ to contain large number of constants.

Since such interfaces do not contain methods,there is no need to worry about implementing any methods. 

The constant value will be available to any class that implements the interface.
The values can be used in any method, as part of any variable declaration, or anywhere where we can use a final value.

Example:
interface A 
{
int m=10;
int n=50;
}
class B implements A
{ 
int x=m;
void methodB(int size)
{

	if: size < n
}
}

</pre>
