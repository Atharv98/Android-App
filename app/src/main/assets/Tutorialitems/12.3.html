	<h1><center>12.3 Creating an Executable Applet</center></h1>
	<pre>
		

To create an executable jar file there should be a main class (a class with a main method) inside the jar to run the software. 
An applet has no main method since it is usually designed to work inside a web browser.

Executable applet is nothing but the .class file of applet, which is obtained by compiling the source code of the applet.
Compiling the applet is exactly the same as compiling an application using following command.

javac appletname.java

The compiled output file called appletname.class should be placed in the same directory as the source file.
