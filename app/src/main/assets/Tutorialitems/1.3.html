	<h1><center>1.3 Advantages & Disadvantages</center></h1>

<h2>Advantages:</h2>
1. Java is Simple
2. Java is object-oriented because programming in Java is centered on creating objects, manipulating objects, and making objects work together. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.
3. One of the most significant advantages of Java is Platform indenpendence.
4. Java is Secure: Java is one of the first programming languages to consider security as part of its design. 
5. Java is Multithreaded: Multithreaded is the capability for a program to perform several tasks simultaneously within a program.
6. Java is Robust: Robust means reliable and no programming language can really assure reliability.

<h2>Disadvantages:</h2>
1. Java can be perceived as significantly slower and more memory-consuming than natively compiled languages such as C or C++.
2. No local constants. In Java, variables that belong to a class can be made constant by declaring them to be final. Variables that are local to a method cannot be declared final, however.
3. Java is predominantly a single-paradigm language. However, with the addition of static imports in Java 5.0 the procedural paradigm is better accommodated than in earlier versions of Java.
